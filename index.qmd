# Introduction
Each person is a unique and diverse individual. Music is a vast and dynamic landscape, and personal preferences and the emotional impact of songs can vary widely person to person as well. We are in a digital age, where streaming service dominates. This allows the availability of extensive music libraries. From these streaming services, APIs open up new avenues for exploring the diverse facets of musical tastes and emotional resonance in numbers. 

As mentioned earlier, there are a multitude of platforms to stream music. Pandora, Apple Music, Youtube, Amazon, and Spotify are popular choices. In most of these platforms, users are not only listeners. They are the curator of their own musical experiences. These platforms read the user’s data in order to make recommendations and playlists based on their listening preferences. With the “spotifyr” package, we could analyze the the emotions of an artist’s album and look at some insights of the user. 
 
Our decision to explore musical preferences through the Spotify R package is motivated by the desire to understand the intersection of personal taste, emotional connection, and shared musical experiences. By comparing the top tracks between two users, we aim to uncover similarities and differences that may reflect diverse musical journeys and influences. While it is unlikely to have overlap between our top 10 tracks, it is the moods of the artists that could be insightful. Using Spotify's valence and energy variables as proxies for emotional content, we can compare the moods of artists’ albums. This approach allows us to not only appreciate individual songs but also to understand the broader emotional tapestry woven throughout an artist's body of work.

This exploration not only contributes to our understanding of the intricacies of musical preferences but also sheds light on the emotional narratives woven into the fabric of music. By combining data-driven insights from the Spotify R package with the lyrical nuances revealed by the Genius package, we aim to offer a comprehensive perspective on the intersection of personal, emotional, and shared experiences within the realm of music. Through this project, we hope to unravel the richness of musical expression and its profound impact on individual and collective identities.
