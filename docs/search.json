    "text": "2.2 Description\nComparative Analysis of Top Tracks:\nThe Spotify Web API provides access to user-specific data, including the top tracks for each user. By querying the API for both partners, we can retrieve information on their individual top tracks. The data includes details such as track name, artist, album, and popularity. Through the Spotify R package, we can seamlessly compare the top tracks, identifying commonalities and differences in musical preferences. Using the get_my_top_tracks function from the “spotifyr,” we can get the top tracks from each user. We can extract relevant details such as track name, artist, and album and save it to a data frame and visualize it.\nExploring Album Moods:\nLeveraging the Spotify API’s audio features, particularly valence and energy, we can analyze the mood dynamics of artists’ albums. Valence represents the musical positiveness, while energy represents the intensity and activity. By aggregating these features at the album level, we gain insights into the overall emotional content of each album. The Spotify R package allows us to efficiently extract and process this information, enabling us to explore patterns and themes in the emotional landscape of diverse artists. By utilizing the get_audio_features function from the “spotifyr,” we can obtain the valence and energy features for each track. Then. we can aggregate these features at the album level to represent the overall mood. Lastly, we can analyze patterns and trends in mood dynamics across different artists’ albums.\nLyrics and Emotional Expression:\nThe Genius R package provides access to song lyrics, allowing us to perform sentiment analysis and explore emotional expression in the lyrics of selected songs. By querying the Genius API through the “genuis” R package, we can retrieve lyrics for specific tracks of interest. Combining this textual data with the emotional features obtained from the Spotify API, we can deepen our understanding of how lyrics contribute to the overall emotional depth and resonance of the music. We can query the Genius API through the “genuis” to retrieve lyrics for selected tracks. Then we can perform sentiment analysis on the lyrics to quantify emotional expression based on the number of “angry” words identified by NRC’s standards with the help of “tidytext”.\nBy executing these data-driven analyses, we should be able to identify shared musical preferences and unique individual tastes based on top track analysis and visualize the emotional dynamics within albums, offering insights into how artists convey mood through their music. Our project aims to contribute meaningful insights into the intricate relationship between personal music preferences, emotional resonance, and the broader artistic expression found within the world of music."
